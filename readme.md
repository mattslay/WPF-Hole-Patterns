**Project Description**
A simple WPF / C# project to create geometric hole patterns on a WPF Canvas object using the MVVM pattern to observe changes in the UI and update the grapics on the canvas.

(My first WPF/C# code ever....The UI is written WPF XAML, and the support classes and logic is in C#. Thanks to John Fenton and Viv Phillips over on UniversalThread for helping me learn so much about how to work in C# and WPF.)
